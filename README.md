# Embryo collection

The embryos were processed by André Dias accordingly:

* From 4 plugs, only 2 females were pregnant
* Embryos were collected at embryonic stage 10.5 (E10.5)
* There was 10 embryos in total, but 3 were more developed than the others (so these were not used)
* The 7 remaining embryos had the caudal neuropore almost completely closed and around 35 somites
* The tail pieces were isolated and cut around half the presomitic mesoderm (PSM)
* Around 11,000 cells were loaded into the machine (based on the current 10x protocol)
* The cells were counted using a haemocytometer and displayed a nice colour/shape
* The sequencing libraries were prepared using the Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v3.1 protocol
